/*
A promise in JavaScript is exactly what it sounds like - you use it to make a promise to do something, usually asynchronously. When the task completes, you either fulfill your promise or fail to do so. Promise is a constructor function, so you need to use the new keyword to create one. It takes a function, as its argument, with two parameters - resolve and reject. These are methods used to determine the outcome of the promise. The syntax looks like this:
*/

const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

});

// contoh
const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // responseFromServer represents a response from a server
    let responseFromServer;

    if (responseFromServer) {
        resolve("We got the data")// jika janji terpenuhi
    } else {
        reject("Data not received") // jika janji tidak terpenuhi
    }
});

/*
Promises are most useful when you have a process that takes an unknown amount of time in your code (i.e. something asynchronous), often a server request. When you make a server request it takes some amount of time, and after it completes you usually want to do something with the response from the server. This can be achieved by using the then method. The then method is executed immediately after your promise is fulfilled with resolve. Here’s an example:

*/
const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // responseFromServer is set to true to represent a successful response from a server
    let responseFromServer = true;

    if (responseFromServer) {
        resolve("We got the data");
    } else {
        reject("Data not received");
    }
});
// yang dilakukan segera setelah promise berhasil
makeServerRequest.then(result => {
    console.log(result);
});
// yang dilakukan segera setelah promise tidak berhasil (error)
makeServerRequest.catch(error => {
    console.log(error);
});
